HELP='    al-kb-pipemenu an Openbox Pipe Menu for displaying keybinds
    It should normally be called from an openbox menu.

Options (usually passed from the menu):
    -h --help   show this message
    --keybinds  display keybindings defined in rc.xml as a menu
    (The keybinds in the menu are clickable, except for the Openbox
     commands, which just exit the menu.)
    --rcedit    backup and edit rc.xml

If al-keyboard-pipemenu is called with no options (the usual method),
it will output an xml openbox pipemenu for displaying keybindings.

NOTE: Some of the functionality of this pipemenu depends on the script
/usr/bin/al-kb which is provided by the package "archlabs-utilities".
